This is my photo portfolio created while following the Treehouse course How to Make a Website. It is also one of the tasks for Unit 1, Week 2 of Phase 0 of EDA.

One thing I want to fix with this site is that when resizing the screen when it gets down to two columns the images dance around. There is sometimes three images in the left column and sometimes two. I would like there to always be three in the left column.
